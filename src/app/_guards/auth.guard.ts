The auth guard is used to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing restricted routes.
The auth guard will return:
TRUE: If the user is logged in and is authenticated to access the route
FALSE: If the user is logged out, thus not authenticated to access the route

Here the route access condition is to be logged in (it works on the presence of a valid JWT token)
There can be other conditions too, like role based authentication
